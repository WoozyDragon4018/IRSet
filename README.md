# IRSet
An NewGRF Set based on the Majestic Indian Railways!
## Getting Started
This will help you to get started with the IRSet.
### Installation
* First download/clone this Git and download it to your computer.
* Then, if you have OpenTTD, navigate to your "C:\Users\[user]\Documents\OpenTTD\newgrf" Folder
* Open another Explorer Window or open a File Manager Window, and navigate to the path where you have installed the ZIP file.
* Extract the Compressed ZIP file, then you'll find a file named [irset.grf](irset.grf). That's what you need!
* Copy the file [irset.grf](irset.grf) to your previously opened Documents\OpenTTD\newgrf folder.
* And you're done! Run the Game, and enable the NewGRF and you can enjoy the Indian Trains yourself!

### Compiling
* First you need a lot of things, NMLC.exe, PIL, PLY etc. Follow this [https://www.tt-wiki.net/wiki/NMLTutorial/Installation#Installing_NML_3]website to know about installation of NML
* You have to open your Command Prompt, type `nmlc --grf irset.grf irset.nml` to compile the file if you edited it after all installation is done.
* Voila! Your file will be compiled into a GRF file!
